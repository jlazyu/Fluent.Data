# Src Folder
This folder should contain source code or folders containing source code for the application.

For simple applications that are comprised of a single Visual Studio solution file, the solution file should be placed directly in this folder with projects placed in subfolders.

For more complex solutions and applications that don't use Visual Studio, solutions and other files may be placed anywhere underneath this folder as appropriate.
